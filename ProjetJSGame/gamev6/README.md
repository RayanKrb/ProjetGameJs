The goal of our project was to make a game of AIM (a game where the goal is to train its levels of precision when using a mouse). Aim for boules without missing them.
## Score
Setting up a score for the number of spheres destroyed.
## GameOver
An ending that will put your number of destroyed spheres.
## Launch of the Game
The game is launched in html locally host from the code so open the index.html file
## Game Operation
You will just need to click in the direction of the spheres to destroy them and projections will be created by each left click with the given direction. If the destroyed spheres touch you without having destroyed them before they touch you, you lose the game. So GameOver
## Size
The spheres that rush on you have different sizes so that it has more diffuclt to touch them when it changes shape. Like the little spheres.
## Bonus
Bonus spheres that are not going to target you to hit you that will wander around the game, if you hit them you get a boost that will increase the size of your projectiles. What will facilitate the touch of the spheres .
## Star Game
